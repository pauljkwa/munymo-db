              <p>
                Welcome to Munymo, where financial insight meets competitive
                spirit! Each day, you'll be presented with a pair of publicly
                traded companies (e.g., Company A vs. Company B).
              </p>
              <p>
                Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to predict
                which company's stock will perform better by the end of that
                trading day. Will Company A outperform Company B, or vice
                versa? Make your prediction before the market opens!

              <p>
                To aid your decision, you'll receive a clue about the general
                sector or industry for the <em>next</em> day's company pair.
                Use this information strategically to research and prepare your
                prediction in advance. This clue is revealed after you submit
                your prediction for the current day.

              <p>
                The leaderboard ranks players based on a combination of factors:
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                <li>

                Leaderboards are exchange-specific, so you can compete with others 
                trading on the same markets. Check back regularly to see your rank improve as

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary">The MunyIQ Score System</h2>
              <p>
                For our premium subscribers, we offer the exclusive MunyIQ score systemâ€”a comprehensive 
                metric that measures your stock prediction prowess on a scale of 1-200.
              </p>
              <p>
                Your MunyIQ score is calculated based on five key components:
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                <li>
                  <strong>Accuracy (40%):</strong> The percentage of your predictions that were correct
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Consistency (20%):</strong> How stable your performance is over time, avoiding wild swings
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Speed (20%):</strong> How quickly you make your predictions after a game opens
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Participation:</strong> Initially 20% for the first 20-game streak, then reduces to 10% for subsequent streaks
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Improvement:</strong> After 40+ games (your second 20-game streak), a 10% weight is applied to reward your growth over time
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                MunyIQ provides a deeper analysis of your performance than the leaderboard alone, with performance 
                levels ranging from Beginner (1-74) to Elite (175-200). It also shows your percentile rank compared to 
                all other premium users and tracks your score history over time.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Important note:</strong> Your MunyIQ score is calculated only after you complete a 20-game streak and
                is recalculated after each subsequent 20-game streak. This makes consistent participation and improvement 
                over time key factors in maximizing your score.
              </p>
              <p>
                Use your MunyIQ insights to identify strengths and areas for improvement in your prediction strategy!
